 * Every inbound bank SMS, matched or not.

 * The original webhook parsed an SMS, failed to find a matching pending transaction, and
 * returned `{ success: false }` — discarding it. But the money had already arrived in the
 * bank account. Any late transfer, mistyped amount, or SMS that landed after the 10-minute
 * window became a silent loss that nobody could even discover afterwards.
 *
 * Now nothing is discarded: unmatched messages queue here for an operator to resolve, and
 * the hash makes redelivery of the same SMS a no-op.
